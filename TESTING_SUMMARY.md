# Testing Summary for Git Repository Monitor

## Issues Fixed

1. **Directory traversal error**: The `cd` command in `repo_needs_pull` was changing the working directory for subsequent iterations. Fixed by using a subshell.

2. **Find command syntax**: The `-maxdepth` parameter must come before `-name` in the find command.

3. **Path handling with spaces**: The iCloud path contains spaces and was being split incorrectly. Fixed by using null-terminated output (`-print0`) and proper array handling.

4. **Error output in BTT**: Git errors were appearing in the BTT display. Fixed by redirecting stderr to /dev/null.

## Current Status

The script now:
- ✅ Correctly finds all Git repositories in configured directories
- ✅ Handles paths with spaces (like iCloud directories)
- ✅ Outputs clean JSON for BetterTouchTool without error messages
- ✅ Detects repository status (ahead, behind, up-to-date)

## How to Test

### 1. Quick Test
```bash
# Run the script directly
./git_monitor.sh
# Expected: {"text":"✅", "font_color":"0,200,0,255"} or similar
```

### 2. Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with debug output
bash -x ./git_monitor.sh 2>&1 | tail -20
```

### 3. Test Repository Detection
```bash
# Use the debug test script
./debug_test.sh
```

### 4. Test BTT Integration
1. In BetterTouchTool, check that the Shell Script Widget is configured correctly
2. Click the menu bar item to ensure `open_in_iterm.scpt` runs
3. Verify that `show_repos.sh` opens in iTerm

## Known Limitations

1. **Performance**: With `SKIP_FETCH=false`, the script can be slow if you have many repositories or slow network
2. **SSH Keys**: If using `SKIP_FETCH=false`, ensure SSH keys are set up for private repositories
3. **Branch Tracking**: Only works with repositories that have upstream branches configured

## Recommended Settings

For best performance:
```bash
SKIP_FETCH=true     # Rely on periodic manual fetches
MAX_REPOS=15        # Limit to prevent timeouts
```

## Next Steps

To verify everything is working:
1. Wait for a repository to actually be behind its remote
2. Or create a test by doing `git reset --hard HEAD~1` in a test repo
3. Run `git_monitor.sh` and confirm it shows ⬇️ with a count
4. Click the BTT menu item and verify the interactive menu works
