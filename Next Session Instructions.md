# Next Session Instructions

**Last Updated:** Tuesday, January 14, 2025 at 2:34 AM

## Latest Session - 2025-01-14 02:30 AM
- Duration: ~5 minutes
- Main focus: Removed Obsidian vault from repository monitoring configuration
- Issues worked: None (quick configuration update)

## Current State
- Branch: main
- Uncommitted changes: 2 files (README.md, git_utils.sh)
- Work in progress: Configuration cleanup completed, changes need to be committed

## Completed This Session
- ✅ Removed Obsidian folder from REPOS_ROOT_DIRS in git_utils.sh
- ✅ Simplified configuration to only monitor DevProjects directory

## Next Priority
1. Commit the configuration changes with appropriate message
2. Consider pushing to remote repository if one exists
3. Test the monitoring system to ensure it still works correctly with only DevProjects

## Important Context
- The git monitoring system was checking both DevProjects and the Obsidian vault
- Removed the Obsidian vault path to simplify monitoring scope
- The REPOS_ROOT_DIRS array now only contains "$HOME/DevProjects"

## Commands to Run Next Session
```bash
# Continue where left off
cd /Users/shayon/DevProjects/automonitor-git-repos
git status
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: remove Obsidian vault from monitoring scope

- Simplified REPOS_ROOT_DIRS to only monitor DevProjects
- Reduces unnecessary monitoring overhead for non-development repositories"
```

## Configuration Details
The modified configuration in git_utils.sh now looks like:
```bash
REPOS_ROOT_DIRS=(
  "$HOME/DevProjects"
)
```

This change ensures the monitor only checks actual development projects and not the Obsidian vault.
